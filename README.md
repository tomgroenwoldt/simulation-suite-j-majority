# Bachelor thesis "`<title>`"

### File watcher
I'm using my daily editor for writing the thesis. I added functionality to recompile the document
on file change.

##### Dependencies
Install the following dependencies:
```
  sudo pacman -S inotify-tools evince
```

To start the file watcher run:

```
cd thesis/
./watch.sh

```
